         <b>Srinivas Theatre v. </b>state of T.N., Reddy, J., has noted that equality before law is a dynamic concept having many facets. one of them there is that there shall be no privileged person of class and name shall be above state law.

        <h3><u>Permination & Prohibition Of Article 14</u></h3>
        <p>Article 14 permits classification but prohibits class legislation the equal protection of law guaranteed by article 14 does not mean that all laws must be general in character. It does not mean that the same laws should apply to all persons. It does not mean that every law must have universal application for, all person are not, by nature, attainment or circumstances in the same position. The varying need of different classes of persons often require separate treatment. From the very nature of society there should be different places and the legislature controls the policy and enacts laws in the best interest of the safety and security of the state. In fact, identical amount to unequal circumstances would amount to inequality. Thus, a reasonable classification is permitted for the develop society. article is forbids is class-legislation but it does not forbids reasonable classification. The classification, however, must not be “Arbitrary, artificial or evasive” but must be based on some real and substantial Distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation to the object sought be achieved by the legislation.Article 14 implied where equals are treated differently without any reasonable basis. But where equals and unequal are treated differently, article 14 does not apply class legislation is that which makes an improper discrimination by conferring particular privileges upon a class of persons arbitrarily selected from a large number of persons, all of whom stand in the same relation to the privilege granted that between whom and the persons, not so favored no reasonable distinction or substantial difference can be found justifying the inclusion of one and the exclusion of the other from such privilege.</p>

        <b>Special provision for women and Children and SC,ST & backward classes :</b>
        <p>Article 14 of Indian constitution law says that all are equal in the eye of law. No one can prevent the state from making any special provisions for women and children. For a examples, special seating arrangement for women in buses, trains, metros trains is not unconstitutional. It was held by court that “reservation of some seats for women in college.”</p>

        <p>According to section 497 of Indian penal code, audultery is consider as offence when it committed by men , not consider offence if committed by women thus women cannot be Prosecuted for abetters. It is clear that it makes special provision for women and which is valid Under constitution law article 15(3). Section 437 of cr.p.c., 1973 restricts the release of an accused person a capital offence on Bail except women, children under age of 16 years or ill or infirm persons. in Choki v. State of Rajasthan, the court has held that it valid on the grounds make special Provision for women and therefore, it is protected under article. Article 15(4) has been inserted by the constitution ( first amendment ) Act, 1951. This amendment has been changed in the supreme court case state of Madras v. champakam dorairajan. In this case, the reservation of seats for the admission to state medical and engineering colleges was made on the ground of caste and religion. The court said that it unconstitutional on the ground that it was based on communal matter. Article 15(4) was interested in the Indian constitution law after the amendment. the aim to empower the government to make special provisions for the betterment of educationally and socially backward classes of citizen of India and for the Scheduled tribes and scheduled castes. State has made many special provision for the weaker sections such as ST,SC and educationally and socially backward classes of citizens of India., Meaning of “ Scheduled caste” means such castes, race, or tribes or parts of or groups within Such castes, races or tribes as are deemed under article 341 to be scheduled castes for the purposes of this constitution.article 341(1) provide additional protection to the members of the scheduled castes having regard to the social, economical, educational, backwardness from which they suffer because of their caste.</p>
